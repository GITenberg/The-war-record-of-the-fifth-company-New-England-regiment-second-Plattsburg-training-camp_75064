<p class="noindent">We trust that any errors or omissions which may be found in
this book will be overlooked, as due to the nature of the subject
it was particularly difficult to make a perfect and complete
record.</p>

<p>Had it been possible in November, 1917, to have foreseen
the futures of all the 5th Company men and published these
records at that time, this book would undoubtedly have
been of far greater interest than it is at present. We hope,
however, that even now it will be of lasting value as a reminder
of old friends and stirring times.</p>
